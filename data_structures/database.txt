Details
-------
This data structure represents a database of information for a particular disc,
disc set, or mission.  Most entries are self-evident.  A few less obvious ones:
"eyecatch" holds the filename of the eyecatch; "icon" holds the filename of the
disc, disc set, or mission icon; and "records" is the amount of scores in the
ranking.  The ranking is a list of lists.  Each list represents the score for
one DJ.  List index 0 is the DJ rank, followed by the DJ icon filename, the DJ
name, and finally index 3 is the score.

Special Values
--------------
None.

This structure is generated automatically and should not be edited manually.
