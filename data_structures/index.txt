Details
-------
The index is a dictionary of all available names.  Each game mode has a slightly
different structure, but are essentially identical.  Each name key accesses a
dictionary that contains the page where the disc shows up in the ranking section
of the DJMAX site.  For the Star and Pop structure, the difficulty levels are
included.  The difficulty key is called "level" in the Star structure, and
referred to by the chart in the Pop structure.  Difficulty levels must be
maintained manually since DJMAX does not list them anywhere.  Timestamp is a
value indicating when this particular database was updated.

Special Values
--------------
A difficulty level of 0 is used to indicate the non-existence of a chart for the
Star and Pop structures.  However, this value currently serves no purpose.

Notes
-----
The Star and Pop structure has elements that must be maintained by hand.
