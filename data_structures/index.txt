Details
-------
The index is a dictionary of all available discs, disc sets, or missions.  Each
game mode has its own index, and each entry in the index represents a database
in DJRivals.  Indexes are keyed by the full title.  The "timestamp" key marks
when a database was last updated, while "page" indicates where the title appears
in the ranking section of the DJMAX site.

Special Values
--------------
None.
